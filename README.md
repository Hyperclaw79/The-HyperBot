# HyperBot: The discord.py bot being created by Hyperclaw79#3570. 

HyperBot is a Discord multipurpose bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage"). It performs multiple tasks which can be found using the help command (H!help).



### How do I set it up?
 
It's still being developed and hence is buggy and incomplete. DM Hyper for the invite link.



### Commands 

Commands can be listed using the H!help command.



### Configuration

 The main configuration file is `config/options.ini`.



### Great, now how do I use it? 
Download the bot, set the dependencies up, then run `runbot.bat`! (or `run.sh` on mac/linux)  Read the tutorial if you don't know what to do.


P.S. The commands under the MusicBot section, some in Misc section, some in Owner_Only section and in unsegmented sections are all native code from the Open Source MusicBot. Kudos to Daniel (imayhaveborkedit) for making this amazing bot.
